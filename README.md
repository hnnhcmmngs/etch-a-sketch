# etch-a-sketch

The Etch-A-Sketch game can be played by dragging the mouse across
the drawing board. By selecting one of the stylus options (pencil, 
rainbow, or eraser), the squares on the grid will either turn gray
and darken with each subsequent pass of the mouse, will turn a
random rgb value, or will revert back to white. When the 'Choose
Grid Size' button is selected, the user can enter a value between
1 and 100 in the prompt and the grid will be reset with that number
as its dimension for each side. The grid can also be reset by
refreshing the page.
